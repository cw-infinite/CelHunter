Cannot let users edit the raw HTML data to make their gallery look like they want
--> issue: users being able to put a <script> tag, their own ads etc. into their gallery
--> alternative: give them 'insertion points' like letting them to choose font, color, background image etc. through a user interface

Need to put a data cap on accounts
--> issue: a spam botnet uploading 100 TB of data and costing me $$$$
--> alternative: put a 1GB cap on each gallery (1 gb should be enough)

Need to put a data cap on images
--> issue: uploading an insanely high-res image costing $$ and performance issues
--> alternative: put a 10 MB cap on each photo (is that too much?)

Need to validate that they're uploading photos
--> issue: uploading some sort of script that gets executed or a video that takes up a lot of $$
--> alternative: input validation to make sure it's a jpeg or png file (or some other validation)

Need an authentication mechanism:
--> issue: someone changing a gallery not theirs or anonymous users messing with stuff
--> alternative: not sure yet... there's a limit of 5,000 IAM users but users might not be way to go
--> alternative: using Cognito to give credentials and have them sign in with an OpenID provider (google, facebook etc)
