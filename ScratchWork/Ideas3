  new service combination:
    S3                    host pictures and static web pages
    cloudfront            cache the S3 stuff
    dynamodb              database storage
    lambda                functions to run
    api gateway           call our lambda functions
    sns                   email alerts
    cognito               authentication
    acm                   ssl certificates
    R53                   DNS
  
  cognito is an aws-run authentication service
    store 'user pools' - usernames for people
    store 'identity pools' - roles/permissions for people
    ^^I believe the roles are aws-service roles being used; however i also believe there are ways to tie them into our application, specifically through tokens
    handles passing off JWT's, cookies snd other authentication stuff
    provides its own sign-in page that can be customized and allows signing up and stuff
    50,000 monthly average users is the free limit
    thoughts: use this to authenticate users to act as contributors and give access to page to edit their gallery
  
  cloudfront is a content distribution network service
    host s3 content in the cloudfront cache; brings cost/network usage down by cachine it at edge locations, makes website faster
    thoughts: host the s3 content (eg images and angular interface) in cloudfront
    
  acm (AWS certificate manager) service
     provides free ssl certificates for the website
     thoughts: pretty straight forward, request ssl certs using a wildcard so the whole site has https and set to https only
     
  sns (simple notification service)
     provides messaging based in event triggers. pub/sub.
     events publish to s topic and subscribers sub to that topic to get the message
     message is configurable
     thoughts: use to let users get emails based on when a person they sub to uploads a new image or when an anime series they sub to gets a new image added
   
   route53 (dns service)
     used for name resolution and buying domain names
     need a hosted zone that contains the dns records for a domain
     actually need at least 2 zones. one for the http//:
